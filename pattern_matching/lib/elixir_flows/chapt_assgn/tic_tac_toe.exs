# Create a function that returns Tic-Tac-Toe game winners. You can repre- sent the board with a tuple of nine elements, where each group of three items is a row. The return of the function should be a tuple. When we have a winner, the first element should be the atom :winner, and the second should be the player. When we have no winner, the tuple should contain one item that is the atom :no_winner. It should work like this:
# TicTacToe.winner({
#   :x, :o, :x,
#   :o, :x, :o,
#   :o, :o, :x
# })
# # {:winner, :x}
# TicTacToe.winner({
#   :x, :o, :x,
#   :o, :x, :o,
#   :o, :x, :o
# })
# # :no_winner
